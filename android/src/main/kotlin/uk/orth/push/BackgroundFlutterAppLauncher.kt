/**
 * This class is used when the application was terminated when the push notification is received. It
 * launches the Flutter application and sends it a RemoteMessage. See
 * [PushHostHandlers] to see where push notifications being handled whilst the app is
 * in the background or the foreground. Use this class when no existing Flutter Activity is running.
 *
 * This class can be generalized to launch the app manually for any purpose, but currently it is
 * narrowly scoped for push notifications.
 *
 * Creates a Flutter engine, launches the Flutter application inside that Flutter engine, and
 * creates a MethodChannel to communicate with the Flutter application.
 *
 * @param context
 * @param broadcastReceiver The FirebaseMessagingReceiver which received the message
 * @param intent An intent containing a RemoteMessage passed straight from
 * FirebaseMessagingReceiver
